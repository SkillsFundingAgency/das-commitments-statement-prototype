    "standardInformation": "&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Groundworkers are the first trade onto a construction and civil engineering site and they work closely with supervisors and engineers in interpreting design specifications to prepare the site ready for the structural building works to take place. They continue their work throughout the construction phase, working with all on-site construction trades, such as bricklayers and plant operatives, up to and including the final completion activities of the project. Their work includes setting out and preparing the sub-surfaces ready for the structural work to begin, installing drainage systems, concreting, constructing roads and pathways and carrying out the finished hard landscaping. Groundworkers are able to transfer between heavy construction and civil engineering sites as well as house building, commercial building and general building sites. Groundworkers work for all types of construction companies from small subcontractors to large main contractors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table style=&quot;height: 1167px; width: 616px;&quot; width=&quot;956&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 616px;&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Knowledge&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td style=&quot;width: 616px;&quot; width=&quot;616&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Groundworkers have the knowledge and understanding of:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;the principles of health, safety, welfare and environmentally responsible work practices and how they must be applied in relation to the work, self and to others including understanding the principles of risk assessments&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Basic awareness of environmental and health hazards e.g. Japanese knotweed, asbestos.
