Their work is likely to include handling day to day queries and providing HR advice; working on a range of HR processes, ranging from transactional to relatively complex, from recruitment through to retirement; using HR systems to keep records; providing relevant HR information to the business; working with the business on HR changes. They will typically be taking ownership for providing advice to managers on a wide range of HR issues using company policy and current law, giving guidance that is compliant and where errors could expose the organisation to employment tribunals or legal risk. In a larger organisation they may also have responsibility for managing a small team – this aspect is outside the scope of this apprenticeship and will need to be covered separately by the employer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;table&gt;\r\n&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 83px;&quot; width=&quot;83&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;th style=&quot;width: 447px;&quot; width=&quot;447&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is required&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/th&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;83&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Business understanding&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;447&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Understands the structure of the organisation; the products and services it delivers; the external market and sector within which it operates; where their role fits in the organisation; the ‘Values’ by which it operates and how these apply to their role.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;83&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;HR Legislation and Policy&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td width=&quot;447&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Basic understanding of HR in their sector and any unique features.
