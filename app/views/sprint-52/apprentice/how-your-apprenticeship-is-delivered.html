      </div>

      <p>Your portable flexi-job apprenticeship will be delivered in two parts:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>a training period when you will move between different jobs</li>
        <li>an end-point assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your training period</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Your employers</strong> will give you hands-on experience in your chosen
        occupation. They'll provide you with training and supervision to help you develop
        the skills you need to perform the role you've been employed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Each individual employer</strong> will help you develop some of the skills required for your
        apprenticeship.
        When a job ends, you'll need to find a new job to develop more of the required skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Your training provider</strong> is responsible for your off-the-job training. Your required hours for
        off-the-job training are stated in your training plan as agreed by you, your provider and each employer.
        You'll spend this time learning new knowledge, skills and behaviours for your apprenticeship.
        Your training provider will manage your off-the-job training.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Your training plan</strong> is agreed between you and your training provider, with input from your
        employers at the start of each job. The plan will set out a training schedule for your off-the-job training.
        Your training plan will include:
      </p>



      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the delivery of the knowledge, skills and behaviours required for your apprenticeship</li>
        <li>how and when your off-the-job training will be delivered</li>
        <li>English and maths qualifications, if you have not already achieved these</li>
        <li>regular progress reviews with your employer and training provider</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your end-point assessment</h2>
      <p>
        You'll be assessed by an independent end-point assessor on the knowledge, skills
        and behaviours that you've learnt during your apprenticeship to confirm you're
        occupationally competent.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will agree when you're ready for your end-point assessment in your progress
        reviews with your employer and training provider.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your employer and training provider will tell you what to expect and when the
        assessment will take place.
