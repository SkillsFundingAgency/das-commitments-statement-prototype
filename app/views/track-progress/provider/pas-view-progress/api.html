          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What our APIs do</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let applications share information and data with each other. </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">We have three APIs you can use:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li><strong>Recruitment API</strong> - this allows you to create adverts on Find an apprenticeship, using your own systems. If you want to create vacancies on employers' behalf using the API, you will need their permission. They can do this in their Apprenticeship service account</li>
            <li><strong>Display adverts API</strong> - this allows you to display adverts from Find an apprenticeship on your own websites</li>
            <li><strong>Track portable flexi job apprenticeship progress API</strong> - this allows us to access data on the progress of your portable flexi-job apprenticeships. This API is only for providers delivering these apprenticeships as part of a pilot</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Setting up the APIs</h2>
          <div class="govuk-inset-text">You will need someone to connect your system with the APIs. As this is a technical process, the person best equipped is likely a software developer.</div>
          <p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="#">Share this page</a> 
            with the developer who is going to connect your system with the API. They will be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided..
          </p>
<!--           <p class="govuk-body">You will need to give your developer API keys. The keys give your developer
            permission to connect to the API on your behalf.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Your developer will also be able to try out the API using the sandbox provided.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you want to create vacancies for employers using the API you will need them to
            give you permission to create vacancies on their behalf, they can do this in their Apprenticeship
            service account.</p> -->

          <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Finding the API keys</h2>
          <p class="govuk-body">You will need to give your developer API keys. The keys give your developer permission to connect to the API on your behalf.</p>
